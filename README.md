# In-Class Project

## Part 1

- [ ] Ensure the content in the `.news` stories is all left-aligned
- [ ] Add padding to the stories such that the image will still touch the edges of the `.news` item, but the text will have `1em` on the left and right sides
- [ ] Change the overall `font` to give all headings a `sans-serif` Google font (your choice), give the remaining text a `serif` Google font
- [ ] Give the `.news` box a 50% transparent black `box-shadow` **(research)**
- [ ] Round the corners (`0.5em`) of the `.news` elements **(research)**
- [ ] For each `.story`, add a link to a page named `story.html` (doesn't exists yet) under the last paragraph. Style it to look like a full width "button" (but it should remain an anchor)
- [ ] At the bottom, build a custom "pagination" component to look similar to:
    ```
    <last 1 2 3 4 next>
    ```
  Each number should be independently clickable to link to another page (`page2.html`, etc). Show "1" to appear "active" (ie, you are currently viewing page 1) by adding a class in the appropriate place.

## Part 2

- [ ] Turn the layout into a grid when necessary (based on your subjective observation) using a breakpoint
- [ ] If necessary, crop the height of the images using CSS (so they don't grow to be too tall as the page grows in width)
